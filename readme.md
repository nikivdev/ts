# TS

## Setup

Install [task](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation). Then run `task setup` & follow instructions until it says `‚úîÔ∏è you are setup`.

## Commands

Run `task` to see all possible commands.

## `flow` CLI

`flow` is a CLI as a dump of various commands written in TS that are useful to me. See [cli/flow](cli/flow) for its code/docs.

Run `task deploy` to install `flow-ts` into PATH. It also puts `fj` command in path (my own personal shorthand, but you can change it).

## Contributing

Any PR to improve is welcome. [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) & [cursor](https://cursor.com) are nice for dev. Great **working** & **useful** patches are most appreciated (ideally). Issues with bugs or ideas are welcome too.
